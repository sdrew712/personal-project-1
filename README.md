Recipize has 2 core features: its user-inputted recipe book and its recipe finding API.

The recipe book will take in any values inputted by the user and store them in its backend server. Each time the user clicks "Create recipe", it will generate a new recipe to be displayed on the page that can be removed anytime with the "delete" button.

The recipe finding feature generates a random recipe from TheMealDB API and displays it on the page. It's complete with an image, ingredients, instructions, and even a Youtube video on how to prepare it.
